# 1 Introduction

<!-- 200 words maximum -->

The integrity of student information systems is vital since they concern personal and confidential information. This report therefore aims to address the security concerns regarding the database system that manages the storage of student records, grades, financial information, and other information typical to a university.

The database under consideration will have many user roles with different levels of access, such as administrators, faculty staff, and students. Robust access controls and relevant security measures must be integrated to prevent misuse through unauthorised access, maintain data integrity, and meet certain regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [@voigt2017].

This report will therefore examine the design of the database, keeping in mind security aspects through the related practical implementations to address the risks and threats identified. Additionally, the report will further explore role-based security logic, appropriate controls to avoid unauthorised access, and the underlying importance of data auditing with the overarching goal of maintaining a secure system [@bertino2005].

Via industry practices and the aforementioned security measures, the university can be confident that the student information is attributed to the elements of the CIA triad â€“ that is the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data [@samonas2014]. This ensures the protection of sensitive data, also meaning that the stakeholders gain confidence [@elmasri2016].
